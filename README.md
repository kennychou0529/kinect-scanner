# 3D Scanner using Kinect (University Project â€” May 15, 2013)

[Dissertation](http://1drv.ms/1GMsnrg)

## Original Aims of the Project

To use a Microsoft Kinect sensor and standard, comodity turntable hardware (lasy susan) to generate three dimensional representation of an object to be scanned, as it rotates on top of the aformentioned table. Turntable pose and tracking mechanisms, image filters, and point cloud alignment optimisations were to be implemented to give the best possible output from the system. Calibration was to be fully automated with no user input required.

## Work Completed

A fully working scanning system was produced which could generate recognisable representations of the objects recorded and processed by the software. Calibration is semi-automated, requiring some basic input from the user.
